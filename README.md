# ðŸ§  Multi-Agent LangGraph Notebook

This project demonstrates how to build a **multi-agent system** using [LangGraph](https://docs.langchain.com/langgraph/) â€” a library designed for stateful, multi-agent workflows built on top of LangChain. The notebook includes agents that collaborate through a graph-based structure to solve tasks such as information retrieval, refinement, and decision-making.


## ðŸš€ Features

- Multi-agent architecture using LangGraph
- Integration with OpenAI LLMs
- State management and transition logic
- Modular and extendable nodes (agents)
- Easy-to-follow example in Jupyter Notebook
